When you drive your car, or walk through a crowd, you are engaging in a collaborative and/or competitive environment with other agents. This phenomenon makes the world an exciting place because it requires individuals to learn game-oriented strategies for all aspects of life which maximize our returns, whether it be longevity, wealth, or happiness. The environment is typically partially observable, necessitating decision making strategies which are capable of accounting for uncertainties in highly complex domains.</p> <p>In this workshop, we aim to explore these ideas by presenting the latest advancements in multi-agent reinforcement learning and game theory from top researchers and practitioners in the field. The workshop will cover a broad range of topics, including multi-robot coordination and communication, task allocation, resource management, planning, control, and game theory. Additionally, we encourage topics on algorithmic approaches for multi-task expertise and distillation. </p> <p>The workshop will include practical demonstrations and hands-on sessions to provide participants with the requisite tools to enable robots to interact in a highly complex, multi-agent world. </p>"},{"location":"#location-and-date","title":"Location and Date","text":"<p>October 1st, 2023 in Detroit, Michigan IROS Conference Room 2993</p>"},{"location":"#schedule","title":"Schedule","text":"Time Activity 9:00 Opening Remarks: Drew Hanover &amp; Ben Moran 9:10-9:40 Peter Stone 9:45-10:15 Dimitra Panagou 10:15-10:30 Q &amp; A 10:30-11:00 Coffee Break 11:05-11:35 Andrew Davison 11:40-12:10 Ben Moran 12:15-12:30 Q &amp; A 12:30-1:30 Lunch 1:35-2:10 Mac Schwager 2:15-3:30 Posters Session and Coffee Break 3:30-4:30 Contributed Papers Lightning Talks 4:30-5:00 Awards Sesssion and Conclusion"},{"location":"#speakers","title":"Speakers","text":""},{"location":"#ben-moran","title":"Ben Moran","text":"<p>DeepMind made headlines in 2016 after its AlphaGo program beat a human professional Go player Lee Sedol, a world champion, in a five-game match, which was the subject of a documentary film.

I pioneered SLAM with vision from the mid 1990s onwards, and brought the SLAM acronym and methods from robotics to single camera computer vision with the breakthrough MonoSLAM algorithm in 2003 which enabled long-term, drift-free, real-time SLAM from a single camera for the first time, inspiring many researchers and industry developments in robotics and inside-out tracking for VR and AR.</p>"},{"location":"#peter-stone","title":"Peter Stone","text":"<p>Dr. Peter Stone holds the Truchard Foundation Chair in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin.

Despite tremendous progress, there are still open problems, including but not limited to how we can obtain less conservative models of, and responses to, the attacks (beyond worst-case assumptions). In this talk, I will present an overview of our recent work on safety-driven task allocation, and on trust-based adaptation and control for multi-agent systems against adversarial agents.</p> <p>Dimitra Panagou received the Diploma and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece, in 2006 and 2012, respectively. In September 2014 she joined the Department of Aerospace Engineering, University of Michigan as an Assistant Professor. Since July 2022 she is an Associate Professor with the newly established Department of Robotics, with a courtesy appointment with the Department of Aerospace Engineering, University of Michigan. Prior to joining the University of Michigan, she was a postdoctoral research associate with the Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (2012-2014), a visiting research scholar with the GRASP Lab, University of Pennsylvania (June 2013, Fall 2010) and a visiting research scholar with the University of Delaware, Mechanical Engineering Department (Spring 2009). Her research program spans the areas of nonlinear systems and control; multi-agent systems and networks; motion and path planning; human-robot interaction; navigation, guidance, and control of aerospace vehicles. She is particularly interested in the development of provably-correct methods for the safe and secure (resilient) operation of autonomous systems in complex missions, with applications in robot/sensor networks and multi-vehicle systems (ground, marine, aerial, space).
